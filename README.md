## Still Working On
1. UI - To make it more user friendly

## Dependencies :

1. all required jar files are presemt in the Dependencies folder of the project

## How to setup :

1. fork this repo
2. go to code, and copy ssh key
3. Create a folder in your device - git clone {ssh key you copied paste it}
4. Open your netbeans
5. Right click in the pallete in the right, create new category named "my component"
6. Right click on my component, go to pallete manager, add from jar go to the dependencies folder in this repo, select [RSCalendar.jar](https://github.com/sayan2002-github/NewLibraryManagement/blob/master/Library_Management_System/Dependencies/RSCalendar.jar), [RSFoto_v1.0.jar](https://github.com/sayan2002-github/NewLibraryManagement/blob/master/Library_Management_System/Dependencies/RSFoto_v1.0.jar) and [RojeruSan.parte1.jar](https://github.com/sayan2002-github/NewLibraryManagement/blob/master/Library_Management_System/Dependencies/RojeruSan.parte1.jar) and add to my component (this jar files contain text field and buttons that are used in this project)
7. Open the project in netbeans
8. In the library folder in the left add three jar files present in the Dependencies folder jcommon, jfreechart, mysql-connector(better to download the latest version)
9. go to file->project properties -> sources and check source format is JDK 18(latest version) is or not
10. You're ready to go......ðŸš€
